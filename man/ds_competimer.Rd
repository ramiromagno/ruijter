\description{
Competitive primers were synthesized on basis of identical sequence and
blocked by amination at the 3' end to allow annealing, but avoid elongation
during the PCR process.

A six-point 4-fold serial dilution series made from reference human genomic
DNA (Roche), starting from 64 ng/µl down to 0.0625 ng/µl, was created in 10
ng/µl yeast tRNA as carrier. The same dilution of the carrier was used to
create a NTC sample.

qPCR ampliﬁcations were performed in 7.5 µl total reaction volume containing:
\itemize{
\item 3.75 µl 2x custom made qPCR SYBR green I Mastermix (Eurogentec)
\item 0.375 µl forward primer (5 µM) and 0.375 µl reverse primer (5 µM)
\item 1 µl of a mixture of nuclease-free water and equal amounts of both forward and reverse competitive (aminated) primers
\item 2 µl diluted standard
}

A total of 7 competitive mixes were prepared for each dilution point,
containing 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 50\% (of the total amount of
primer) competitive (aminated) forward and reverse primers. Each reaction was
run in triplicate.

The qPCR cycling was performed on the LightCycler480 (Roche) using white
LightCycler480 384-multiwell plates with Light-Cycler480 sealing foils
(Roche).

The cycling conditions were com  prised of 10 min polymerase activation at 95
°C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, followed by a dissociation
curve analysis from 60 to 95 °C.
